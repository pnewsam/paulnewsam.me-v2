      <div class="column content">
        <p>I went to UC Berkeley for Integrative Biology and English, and came out the other end fascinated with evolutionary theory and enamored of field work. I spent the next five or seven years moving around and doing biological surveys for different outfits. I counted birds and measured trees and I loved it.</p>
        <p>I ended up in San Francisco working for a startup called Sourcery, where I did data processing. While I was there, I helped develop the protocols for processing the thousands of food industry invoices that our platform and services were founded on. I started as the only data processor, but by the time I had left I was coordinating with an outsource team of several members, and two others in-house.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="column content">
        <p>I ended up leaving Sourcery to take another couple of biology jobs, but when I was out in the field, I realized that I missed the tech world - the challenge and the immediacy of it. To whet my curiosity, I started coding, and found that I really enjoyed it. I had to think critically and apply my creativity daily in a way that I never did when I was just collecting data in the field. I enrolled in DevBootcamp to accelerate my learning, and now I'm looking for my first gig as a developer.</p>
        <p>Iâ€™d love to get involved in any company where people are passionate about solving real problems and committed to fostering creative solutions. I'm happy to bring anything I've got to contribute to the table.</p>

        <div class="content">
          <p>Ramen Ho! is two apps - a mobile-ready app that informs the ramen-hungry customer which ramen shops have the shortest wait times, and a tablet-ready app that allows ramen shop proprietors to be sure they're seating their customers efficiently. The restaurant-side app is a waitlist, where customers arriving at the shop can sign up to receive notifications when their table is ready. The waittimes generated from that waitlist are broadcasted to the mobile users.</p>
