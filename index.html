      <div class="column content">
        <p>I went to UC Berkeley for Integrative Biology and English, and came out the other end fascinated with evolutionary theory and enamored of field work. I spent the next five or seven years moving around and doing biological surveys for different outfits. I enjoyed getting to know some of the country where I'd been born.</p>
        <p>I moved to San Francisco on a whim, and ended up working for a startup called Sourcery. I did data processing work - pretty menial stuff. But as I stayed on, my responsibilities grew, and I played a hand in developing the protocols for our growing data-processing operation. I started as the only data processor, but by the time I had left I was coordinating with an outsource team of several members, and two others in-house.</p>

      <div class="column content">
        <p>I ended up leaving Sourcery to take another couple of biology jobs, but when I was out in the field again, I realized that I missed the tech world. I wasn't sure what to do next, but I started coding, and fond that I really enjoyed it. I had to think critically and apply my creativity daily in a way that I never did when I was just collecting data in the field. So I decided to give it a go, full-time.</p>

        <div class="content">
          <p>Ramen Ho! is two apps - a mobile-ready app that informs the ramen-hungry customer which ramen shops have the shortest wait times, and a tablet-ready app that allows ramen shop proprietors to be sure they're seating their customers efficiently. The restaurant-side app is a waitlist, where customers arriving at the shop can sign up to receive notifications when their table is ready. The waittimes generated from that waitlist are broadcasted to the mobile users.</p>
